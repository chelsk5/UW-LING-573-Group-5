            "i had to uninstall anti virus and selected other programs some of which did not have listings in the programs and features control panel section  this review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of microsofts latest os  all of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience  i enjoyed the new convenience features in windows 7  they showed me pc laptops that had more features than the macbook and which cost way less than the macbook too  but that aside i like the availability of software the new features like the improved taskbar windows peek and the aero environment  if youre used to os x but want to come into the pc world where things cost less and you get more features by all means consider windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that  after seeing the pricing on the newest macbooks this week and the limited features compared to what i currently own i have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to pc  these new features make the user experience much more superior than anything windows has ever offered  also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users wont use either because it isnt needed or the hardware isnt widely adopted yet  you can read all the new features in your windows 7 short version handbook  but what i really like about windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers  also in windows explorer two new features  all the nifty new features mean squat if my computers dont function properly   then vista but if so none of its features have been impressive enough to have blown me away  it does have some nice features  w7 is fast and resource friendly every hardware device works perfect and theres a ton of great features  runs well but no stand out new features for my usage  having used windows me and xp for several years and before upgrading vista i heard a lot of great things about windows 7 as well as new features  i liked the built in features of vista and of course the appearance but i prefered the stability and speed of xp even with a high end system   better user interface features like being able to view the desktop with one mouse gesture to the bottom right of the screen  least useful features of windows 7 to me  theyre features i dont use  windows 7 ultimate is there too off course but i personally cant bring myself to spend that much more money just to get a tiny few features that i know i will never use like multi language support and bitlocker  its loaded with useful features  it has some features that i personally dont find useful but if in the future i do need them theyre there  there are many features that allow me to personalize my working environment  vista has more features than xp but many of them didnt make the os more usable for me  personally i thought vista was very handsome what with its transparency 3 d effects color schemes and usability improvements to windows explorer and i believe windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy if not more while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements  i havent yet become accustomed to some features like aero shake but hey those things are there if i need them  i cant tell what positives it offers still but its still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over xp that make for a more fun experience for some and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files  did i mention that win7 offers nothing in terms of any new worthwhile features  0 out of 5 stars xp speed stability vista like features without the headaches  i really wanted to like vista with all its cool new features but unfortunately it was a disaster because it just didnt work  and i love all the new aero shake peek snap windows features but i still prefer mac os xs expose   new features with better window and file managment  many features are copied from mac os x of course there are some new features and a little more eye candy if thats important to you too  nice upgrade and love some of the new features snip tool stickys on the desktop docking on the task bar and thanks for clearing the clutter on the tray  w7 has some cool features that i like and im sure i dont even know the half of it yet  i dont have a tv tuner so i cant take advantage of that feature but there are other features it seems to be working good  00 dollars just to upgrade for some fancy new features  since my google sidebar had some features that i liked it allowed me to replace it for the windows one  because others on this site have already described in sufficient detail all the amazing features of w7 i will not repeat them  there are so many more features of this that are very difficult to list all here  all of these features have worked 100 of the time which is previously unheard of  removing a feature from the programs and features panel simply disables access to it but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard drive taking up space  i also noticed improved power management including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used  all the features of vista but without any of the problems  it still works pretty good though just a lack of some features that i had before  what i will highlight are a few features of windows 7 which i have been thoroughly impressed with  perhaps my expectations were low since microsoft oses tend usually to be just functional without much pizazz or many power user shortcuts and features but windows 7 really is a well crafted os  i do not use most of the features such as gaming that seem to benefit most from the upgrade  does the new operating system have cool features  my only complaint would be that i would like to have a family pack available in the windows professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately  seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features  i think the reason it didnt is because it wants to force the user to use the windows live toolbar that includes other features similar to what google offers  smooth os with great little features  a lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what mac os x has had for a couple of years or more  if you didnt come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool so enjoy them for what they are if youve never played around with a mac enough to be comfortable in that environment  i am not going to review the features because theres plenty of that already  there is not a lot of new features in the operating system \n",

            "keep in mind that once you get in a room full of light or step outdoors screen reflections could become annoying  ive used mine outside on a sunny day and the screen is still very much legible  in fact it was much more detailed than the matte screen on my dell d600  some ppl may prefer a higher resolution screen but i dont think its required  i delayed ordering the computer because of the horror stories of bad batteries faulty chargers and blue screen crashes  1 inch screens windows xp operating systems a plethora of usb ports a card reader wifi and most have a few color choices  1 inch screens are a bit cramped if several toolbars have been turned on  some of the asus special on screen controls update and expand features built into the machine have not been all that useful and some border on being advertisements for buying asus stuff  two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life and the led backlighting for the screen  the ways the screen opens enables a smaller footprint when the case is closed although it limits how far back the screen will tilt  surfing the net is a breeze but i did have one blue screen of death when dealing with one demanding internet site  the light weight the battery life the keyboard the non protruding removable battery the bright screen the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat  i recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so  zoom in or zoom out of a screen but on occasion it will zoom when you dont want or expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb etc  the occasional blue screen of death unfortunately has not gone away microsoft attributes it to an errant driver but i have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause  the screen is not as bright as my acer  there are 2 bios updates and the latest is for a brighter screen setting  this makes the screen much brighter and as with all new computers it seems there are always important updates  also if you install firefox web browser and push the f11 key the browser becomes full screen helpful on a small screen  i got used to the glossy screens a while ago this one is remarkably bright and vivid  now i keep getting the blue screen serious errors  wrote it has crashed unexpectedly and displayed the blue screen of death numerous times  sometimes the blue screen of death appears for no discernible reason  i began by considering netbooks with screens smaller than the now standard 10  if money is your leading consideration then one of these may be for you but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen better battery life bigger drive more upgradeable etc  but with screen brightness cranked up bluetooth wi fi in constant use some video playback and internet radio running im getting a good 8 with wi fi off the screen dimmed i dont think ill have a problem getting the stated 10  the keyboard is not quite perfect the screen doesnt tilt back as far as id like slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the u  has an 11 screen with the same or better battery life  its small with a very clear screen  ive had the 1005ha pu1x for a week now on and running applications continuously without a single crash blue screen or hangup  the touchpad feels great the boot up was fast keyboard feels comfortable and the screen is good  my only complaint with it is that the screen doesnt go back far enough  the touchpad works well the screen glossy ness really doesnt bother me and its not too bad of a fingerprint magnet  on full screen display is smooth and no issues  some itunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display but not full screen for some reason but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me  and with a two fingered gesture on the scratchpad you can enlarge or shrink the screen  it wont give you all the functionality of a full sized laptop and the small screen may take some getting used to but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life and most of the functions absent here arent used by most people most of the time anyway so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly increased battery life ill take the latter  on a full charge with wireless on screen brightness on medium i get a reported 8  5 hours with no wireless and screen brightness on minimum  5 pass screen is bright and large enough  once i configured firefox to always run full screen mode surfing was no problem with plenty of screen real estate  all features worked excellently for me so far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button as well as the screen off function key  heavy rearward weight bias so much that it wants to fall backwards with the screen pushed back all the way the screen is stunning and if youve got a bright light shining down on it youve got a choice  you can either move the screen to eliminate the glare or move the lamp  id far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare than deal with a matte screen 24 7  one of the other complaints id come across is how for some the screen doesnt tilt back far enough  yeah youd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat  and if you cant wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable you can always invest in one of those 20 lap desks you know the kind with the beanbag bottom so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy  and i could have gotten a matte screen but neither of those features impressed me  except for difficulties seeing the entire new york times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen the asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5 year old ibm laptop  i was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen shivered although it normally recovered from that  also considered lower end 14 15 screens for use of the dvd  i like the gloss screen fine  the screen is too small for any meaningful work but the apps do work  again the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint  like others have said it is definitely a fingerprint magnet and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions  i received my asus 1005ha yesterday installed the two gb ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank  the screen is small only 1024 x 600  i can hear the windows but my screen is totally blank  i can tell the backlight is on but all i get is a black screen  i dont even see the bios screen on startup  the screen is sharp and bright  the screen is clear and easily viewed in indoor environments  with the view maximized the screen is large enough to work on documents and read online research materials  the fashionable glossiness of both body and screen acquires fingerprints and smears rapidly  the shiny screen is reflective which can be a problem if you have your back to a sunny window or work outdoors  i keep the screen brightness set at about half and easily get more than eight hours with wi fi on  i dont know what the other reviewers are talking about as far as the screen brightness goes because my screen is far too bright at the higher end of the spectrum  it is a fingerprint magnet and because of the glossy screen its very reflective of light   dont know why they use the screen size most do 1024 x 600 seems cramped takes sometime to get use to the small screen  yeah the new led screen technology is that good  the screen resolution isnt the highest you can get but i found that the higher resolution netbooks usually had older prcessors for some reason  im happy with the screen and resolution choices available  i usually run ie8 in full screen mode with a 95 zoom setting and a 1024x600 resolution  surprisingly readable screen for the size  4 do not get wax on your screen  hit f11 and you have full screen browsing just move the cursor to the top of the screen for the controls  the screen really is too small 1024x600 is barely livable  with the battery in the back the computer has most of its weight in the back so the computer easily tips back when the screen is opened all the way up  screen brightness is very satisfactory  asus docking is a program to have a quick menu on top of your screen to access all asus software  the screen is easy to read in outside lighting conditions  my other hp laptop has a mat screen surface and is almost impossible to read outside  long battery life sharp looking machine fingerprint magnetglossy screenglareease of use and portability  the most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality  the cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92 keyboard which is plenty comfortable  the battery life is excellent with normal usage i can get about 7 hours easily more if i turn off wifi and turn down the screen brightness  one of the downside i have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because thats where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesnt tip over and the screen doesnt bend all the way backwards which can be annoy otherwise this is a really nice netbook  screen is nice and adequately sized use fullscreen browsing  i also needed web connectivity for research a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasnt too cramped  the screen size works just fine for me  having the touchpad feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature but i have to admit having never needing to use it  and it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen   im still getting used to the small screen  tiny screen compromises the experience of web surfing ill see the first black screen it appears to be starting and then stays with either a grey or black screen  3 sometimes the screen will all of a sudden distort and i have to re start to get it to work  1 keyboard still floats 2the screen goes to a solid blue screen either right after starting or after it sits a while  great battery life decent sized screen and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on  very nice in fact though i strongly dislike glossy screens no matter i knew it would have one when i ordered it  the battery life has been very good especially if you follow the rule of turning off the wireless and bluetooth and turning down the screen brightness  9 screens but felt that was too much of a sacrifice  the screen is small but still large enough to read comfortably  0 out of 5 stars bad lcd screen october 7 2009 i fired it up and out of the box it has a vertical red line on the lcd screen  just a big dark screen paperweight  the netbook is light and sturdy and it the screen looks great  only 10 inch screen small keyboard and no cd rom  my advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size  decent speed processor nice screen quality great asus softwares and very long battery life  pretty decent screen quality  although the screen is relatively small to my eyes it wasnt really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright no prob reading articles and writing essays  one of the things that i found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen  10 can be enough for some but it was kinda small for me so the thing i did was try to max out the screens by removing unnecessary menus  when using internet explorer or firefox press f11 and the screen will enlarge giving you some additional freedom and space  glossy screens are the stupidest invention of this millenium  seeing reflections on the screen is just plain annoying  as new netbooks come out look for the ones with matt screen and see if it has a good feature set and price  the screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size  with 1gb of ram it really isnt too bad to try to run photoshop or something either but the screen would be too small for something like that anyhow  the battery life is unbelievable even while using usb to transfer files watching movies and surfing the internet with screen brightness all the way up  factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50 but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need  the 1024x600 screen can be set if you wish so that it is a 1024x600 viewport to a larger 1024x768 desktop reachable by moving the mouse to the screen edge  this is useful if you have an application that demands a 1024x768 screen  screen appearance is enhanced by asus software and i do like the appearance and visibility in various lighting situations  the 10 inch screen started getting to me on the asus 1005  i love the capability of making the screen bigger or smaller with the mouse pad  the mouse pad is very sensitive so i sometimes find myself on a different part of the screen if i accidentally touch something  the screen is comfortable and sufficently bright for occassional use  the screen is crisp and clear and the unit runs great  the greatest shortcoming is the small screen resolution  yes screen is small video card is weak and keyboard is cramped but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point  i have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness  streaming videos from hulu and netflix look incredible on this 10 inch screen  the only minor issue that i have with 1005ha is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further  the screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the netbook on desktop  due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard  the screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600  the 10 inch screen is bright and has good color and the keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one  performance is good screen very good wireless very good numerous usb ports and keyboard layout is excellent  it boots up quickly especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto boots at startup its battery life is phenomenal the screen is clear and easy to read the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural  but even with that and the glossy screen fingerprint magnet limited screen tilt tinny speakers and intermittent odd glitches i still think its a great value and would buy it again today if i were on the market for a netbook  now the screen is cracked with big black blotches as well  blue screen crashed several times  hard to see full web pages on small screen resolution inadequate  instead i convert dvds to dvix avi files using fair use wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great 700mb files look fine on this size of screen  the screen resolution can be a little small at times but that is a sacrifice i was willing to make  yes it does take some getting use to a smaller screen the key board actually works better than my laptop though  i was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read but it has been great for everything i run  most of my professors teach from power points and it makes my life so much simpler having the ppt on my screen that i can annotate while listening to the lecture  i have not accidentally knocked it over but i think it could easily be done the screen is glossy  purchased this machine to enjoy the convenience of windows and the larger screen  years old so the screen size was also a concern but it is adequate for the type of things i use it for  as soon as you connect the vga cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen  the keyboard is great and the screen looks good  its also a shame that this model comes with a glossy screen  i personally havent had a problem with the screen but it would be fairly unusable outdoors in the sun  for this extra amount i was looking for the larger screen the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics  i have more productivity flow on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard  this machine is plenty fast its just that if i try to do work with it my offices order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since its a chopped 1024 x 600 height screen instead of the more usual 786  you lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll  the small screen is probably the biggest drawback  could be better and dont use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen it flattens it to make more visible  browsing is amazingly better by using full screen mode on browser with f11  that extra space the menu and address bar take up are sorely needed on this small screen  in full screen browsing it is so much better that i would never go back  because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be smashed so the display is slightly altered  one hint theres a setting that lets you compress the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen  i mostly find that when i make typos its not because of the keyboard its because of the smallness of the screen i just cant see what im doing as well as a laptop  as others have noted i wish the screen wasnt so reflective  and maybe its something i need to figure out how to fix but i dont like the aspect ratio of the screen either  has all the features of my bigger laptop except a large screen  1 inch screen is bigger than the 8  i want a netbook for portability not screen real estate   i was willing to downsize my screen size in favor of portability and speed \n",

            "i had to uninstall anti virus and selected other programs some of which did not have listings in the programs and features control panel section  this review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of microsofts latest os  all of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience  i enjoyed the new convenience features in windows 7  they showed me pc laptops that had more features than the macbook and which cost way less than the macbook too  but that aside i like the availability of software the new features like the improved taskbar windows peek and the aero environment  if youre used to os x but want to come into the pc world where things cost less and you get more features by all means consider windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that  after seeing the pricing on the newest macbooks this week and the limited features compared to what i currently own i have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to pc  these new features make the user experience much more superior than anything windows has ever offered  also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users wont use either because it isnt needed or the hardware isnt widely adopted yet  you can read all the new features in your windows 7 short version handbook  but what i really like about windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers  also in windows explorer two new features  all the nifty new features mean squat if my computers dont function properly   then vista but if so none of its features have been impressive enough to have blown me away  it does have some nice features  w7 is fast and resource friendly every hardware device works perfect and theres a ton of great features  runs well but no stand out new features for my usage  having used windows me and xp for several years and before upgrading vista i heard a lot of great things about windows 7 as well as new features  i liked the built in features of vista and of course the appearance but i prefered the stability and speed of xp even with a high end system   better user interface features like being able to view the desktop with one mouse gesture to the bottom right of the screen  least useful features of windows 7 to me  theyre features i dont use  windows 7 ultimate is there too off course but i personally cant bring myself to spend that much more money just to get a tiny few features that i know i will never use like multi language support and bitlocker  its loaded with useful features  it has some features that i personally dont find useful but if in the future i do need them theyre there  there are many features that allow me to personalize my working environment  vista has more features than xp but many of them didnt make the os more usable for me  personally i thought vista was very handsome what with its transparency 3 d effects color schemes and usability improvements to windows explorer and i believe windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy if not more while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements  i havent yet become accustomed to some features like aero shake but hey those things are there if i need them  i cant tell what positives it offers still but its still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over xp that make for a more fun experience for some and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files  did i mention that win7 offers nothing in terms of any new worthwhile features  0 out of 5 stars xp speed stability vista like features without the headaches  i really wanted to like vista with all its cool new features but unfortunately it was a disaster because it just didnt work  and i love all the new aero shake peek snap windows features but i still prefer mac os xs expose   new features with better window and file managment  many features are copied from mac os x of course there are some new features and a little more eye candy if thats important to you too  nice upgrade and love some of the new features snip tool stickys on the desktop docking on the task bar and thanks for clearing the clutter on the tray  w7 has some cool features that i like and im sure i dont even know the half of it yet  i dont have a tv tuner so i cant take advantage of that feature but there are other features it seems to be working good  00 dollars just to upgrade for some fancy new features  since my google sidebar had some features that i liked it allowed me to replace it for the windows one  because others on this site have already described in sufficient detail all the amazing features of w7 i will not repeat them  there are so many more features of this that are very difficult to list all here  all of these features have worked 100 of the time which is previously unheard of  removing a feature from the programs and features panel simply disables access to it but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard drive taking up space  i also noticed improved power management including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used  all the features of vista but without any of the problems  it still works pretty good though just a lack of some features that i had before  what i will highlight are a few features of windows 7 which i have been thoroughly impressed with  perhaps my expectations were low since microsoft oses tend usually to be just functional without much pizazz or many power user shortcuts and features but windows 7 really is a well crafted os  i do not use most of the features such as gaming that seem to benefit most from the upgrade  does the new operating system have cool features  my only complaint would be that i would like to have a family pack available in the windows professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately  seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features  i think the reason it didnt is because it wants to force the user to use the windows live toolbar that includes other features similar to what google offers  smooth os with great little features  a lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what mac os x has had for a couple of years or more  if you didnt come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool so enjoy them for what they are if youve never played around with a mac enough to be comfortable in that environment  i am not going to review the features because theres plenty of that already  there is not a lot of new features in the operating system \n",

            "keep in mind that once you get in a room full of light or step outdoors screen reflections could become annoying  ive used mine outside on a sunny day and the screen is still very much legible  in fact it was much more detailed than the matte screen on my dell d600  some ppl may prefer a higher resolution screen but i dont think its required  i delayed ordering the computer because of the horror stories of bad batteries faulty chargers and blue screen crashes  1 inch screens windows xp operating systems a plethora of usb ports a card reader wifi and most have a few color choices  1 inch screens are a bit cramped if several toolbars have been turned on  some of the asus special on screen controls update and expand features built into the machine have not been all that useful and some border on being advertisements for buying asus stuff  two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life and the led backlighting for the screen  the ways the screen opens enables a smaller footprint when the case is closed although it limits how far back the screen will tilt  surfing the net is a breeze but i did have one blue screen of death when dealing with one demanding internet site  the light weight the battery life the keyboard the non protruding removable battery the bright screen the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat  i recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so  zoom in or zoom out of a screen but on occasion it will zoom when you dont want or expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb etc  the occasional blue screen of death unfortunately has not gone away microsoft attributes it to an errant driver but i have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause  the screen is not as bright as my acer  there are 2 bios updates and the latest is for a brighter screen setting  this makes the screen much brighter and as with all new computers it seems there are always important updates  also if you install firefox web browser and push the f11 key the browser becomes full screen helpful on a small screen  i got used to the glossy screens a while ago this one is remarkably bright and vivid  now i keep getting the blue screen serious errors  wrote it has crashed unexpectedly and displayed the blue screen of death numerous times  sometimes the blue screen of death appears for no discernible reason  i began by considering netbooks with screens smaller than the now standard 10  if money is your leading consideration then one of these may be for you but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen better battery life bigger drive more upgradeable etc  but with screen brightness cranked up bluetooth wi fi in constant use some video playback and internet radio running im getting a good 8 with wi fi off the screen dimmed i dont think ill have a problem getting the stated 10  the keyboard is not quite perfect the screen doesnt tilt back as far as id like slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the u  has an 11 screen with the same or better battery life  its small with a very clear screen  ive had the 1005ha pu1x for a week now on and running applications continuously without a single crash blue screen or hangup  the touchpad feels great the boot up was fast keyboard feels comfortable and the screen is good  my only complaint with it is that the screen doesnt go back far enough  the touchpad works well the screen glossy ness really doesnt bother me and its not too bad of a fingerprint magnet  on full screen display is smooth and no issues  some itunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display but not full screen for some reason but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me  and with a two fingered gesture on the scratchpad you can enlarge or shrink the screen  it wont give you all the functionality of a full sized laptop and the small screen may take some getting used to but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life and most of the functions absent here arent used by most people most of the time anyway so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly increased battery life ill take the latter  on a full charge with wireless on screen brightness on medium i get a reported 8  5 hours with no wireless and screen brightness on minimum  5 pass screen is bright and large enough  once i configured firefox to always run full screen mode surfing was no problem with plenty of screen real estate  all features worked excellently for me so far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button as well as the screen off function key  heavy rearward weight bias so much that it wants to fall backwards with the screen pushed back all the way the screen is stunning and if youve got a bright light shining down on it youve got a choice  you can either move the screen to eliminate the glare or move the lamp  id far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare than deal with a matte screen 24 7  one of the other complaints id come across is how for some the screen doesnt tilt back far enough  yeah youd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat  and if you cant wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable you can always invest in one of those 20 lap desks you know the kind with the beanbag bottom so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy  and i could have gotten a matte screen but neither of those features impressed me  except for difficulties seeing the entire new york times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen the asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5 year old ibm laptop  i was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen shivered although it normally recovered from that  also considered lower end 14 15 screens for use of the dvd  i like the gloss screen fine  the screen is too small for any meaningful work but the apps do work  again the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint  like others have said it is definitely a fingerprint magnet and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions  i received my asus 1005ha yesterday installed the two gb ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank  the screen is small only 1024 x 600  i can hear the windows but my screen is totally blank  i can tell the backlight is on but all i get is a black screen  i dont even see the bios screen on startup  the screen is sharp and bright  the screen is clear and easily viewed in indoor environments  with the view maximized the screen is large enough to work on documents and read online research materials  the fashionable glossiness of both body and screen acquires fingerprints and smears rapidly  the shiny screen is reflective which can be a problem if you have your back to a sunny window or work outdoors  i keep the screen brightness set at about half and easily get more than eight hours with wi fi on  i dont know what the other reviewers are talking about as far as the screen brightness goes because my screen is far too bright at the higher end of the spectrum  it is a fingerprint magnet and because of the glossy screen its very reflective of light   dont know why they use the screen size most do 1024 x 600 seems cramped takes sometime to get use to the small screen  yeah the new led screen technology is that good  the screen resolution isnt the highest you can get but i found that the higher resolution netbooks usually had older prcessors for some reason  im happy with the screen and resolution choices available  i usually run ie8 in full screen mode with a 95 zoom setting and a 1024x600 resolution  surprisingly readable screen for the size  4 do not get wax on your screen  hit f11 and you have full screen browsing just move the cursor to the top of the screen for the controls  the screen really is too small 1024x600 is barely livable  with the battery in the back the computer has most of its weight in the back so the computer easily tips back when the screen is opened all the way up  screen brightness is very satisfactory  asus docking is a program to have a quick menu on top of your screen to access all asus software  the screen is easy to read in outside lighting conditions  my other hp laptop has a mat screen surface and is almost impossible to read outside  long battery life sharp looking machine fingerprint magnetglossy screenglareease of use and portability  the most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality  the cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92 keyboard which is plenty comfortable  the battery life is excellent with normal usage i can get about 7 hours easily more if i turn off wifi and turn down the screen brightness  one of the downside i have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because thats where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesnt tip over and the screen doesnt bend all the way backwards which can be annoy otherwise this is a really nice netbook  screen is nice and adequately sized use fullscreen browsing  i also needed web connectivity for research a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasnt too cramped  the screen size works just fine for me  having the touchpad feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature but i have to admit having never needing to use it  and it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen   im still getting used to the small screen  tiny screen compromises the experience of web surfing ill see the first black screen it appears to be starting and then stays with either a grey or black screen  3 sometimes the screen will all of a sudden distort and i have to re start to get it to work  1 keyboard still floats 2the screen goes to a solid blue screen either right after starting or after it sits a while  great battery life decent sized screen and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on  very nice in fact though i strongly dislike glossy screens no matter i knew it would have one when i ordered it  the battery life has been very good especially if you follow the rule of turning off the wireless and bluetooth and turning down the screen brightness  9 screens but felt that was too much of a sacrifice  the screen is small but still large enough to read comfortably  0 out of 5 stars bad lcd screen october 7 2009 i fired it up and out of the box it has a vertical red line on the lcd screen  just a big dark screen paperweight  the netbook is light and sturdy and it the screen looks great  only 10 inch screen small keyboard and no cd rom  my advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size  decent speed processor nice screen quality great asus softwares and very long battery life  pretty decent screen quality  although the screen is relatively small to my eyes it wasnt really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright no prob reading articles and writing essays  one of the things that i found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen  10 can be enough for some but it was kinda small for me so the thing i did was try to max out the screens by removing unnecessary menus  when using internet explorer or firefox press f11 and the screen will enlarge giving you some additional freedom and space  glossy screens are the stupidest invention of this millenium  seeing reflections on the screen is just plain annoying  as new netbooks come out look for the ones with matt screen and see if it has a good feature set and price  the screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size  with 1gb of ram it really isnt too bad to try to run photoshop or something either but the screen would be too small for something like that anyhow  the battery life is unbelievable even while using usb to transfer files watching movies and surfing the internet with screen brightness all the way up  factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50 but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need  the 1024x600 screen can be set if you wish so that it is a 1024x600 viewport to a larger 1024x768 desktop reachable by moving the mouse to the screen edge  this is useful if you have an application that demands a 1024x768 screen  screen appearance is enhanced by asus software and i do like the appearance and visibility in various lighting situations  the 10 inch screen started getting to me on the asus 1005  i love the capability of making the screen bigger or smaller with the mouse pad  the mouse pad is very sensitive so i sometimes find myself on a different part of the screen if i accidentally touch something  the screen is comfortable and sufficently bright for occassional use  the screen is crisp and clear and the unit runs great  the greatest shortcoming is the small screen resolution  yes screen is small video card is weak and keyboard is cramped but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point  i have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness  streaming videos from hulu and netflix look incredible on this 10 inch screen  the only minor issue that i have with 1005ha is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further  the screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the netbook on desktop  due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard  the screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600  the 10 inch screen is bright and has good color and the keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one  performance is good screen very good wireless very good numerous usb ports and keyboard layout is excellent  it boots up quickly especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto boots at startup its battery life is phenomenal the screen is clear and easy to read the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural  but even with that and the glossy screen fingerprint magnet limited screen tilt tinny speakers and intermittent odd glitches i still think its a great value and would buy it again today if i were on the market for a netbook  now the screen is cracked with big black blotches as well  blue screen crashed several times  hard to see full web pages on small screen resolution inadequate  instead i convert dvds to dvix avi files using fair use wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great 700mb files look fine on this size of screen  the screen resolution can be a little small at times but that is a sacrifice i was willing to make  yes it does take some getting use to a smaller screen the key board actually works better than my laptop though  i was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read but it has been great for everything i run  most of my professors teach from power points and it makes my life so much simpler having the ppt on my screen that i can annotate while listening to the lecture  i have not accidentally knocked it over but i think it could easily be done the screen is glossy  purchased this machine to enjoy the convenience of windows and the larger screen  years old so the screen size was also a concern but it is adequate for the type of things i use it for  as soon as you connect the vga cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen  the keyboard is great and the screen looks good  its also a shame that this model comes with a glossy screen  i personally havent had a problem with the screen but it would be fairly unusable outdoors in the sun  for this extra amount i was looking for the larger screen the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics  i have more productivity flow on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard  this machine is plenty fast its just that if i try to do work with it my offices order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since its a chopped 1024 x 600 height screen instead of the more usual 786  you lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll  the small screen is probably the biggest drawback  could be better and dont use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen it flattens it to make more visible  browsing is amazingly better by using full screen mode on browser with f11  that extra space the menu and address bar take up are sorely needed on this small screen  in full screen browsing it is so much better that i would never go back  because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be smashed so the display is slightly altered  one hint theres a setting that lets you compress the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen  i mostly find that when i make typos its not because of the keyboard its because of the smallness of the screen i just cant see what im doing as well as a laptop  as others have noted i wish the screen wasnt so reflective  and maybe its something i need to figure out how to fix but i dont like the aspect ratio of the screen either  has all the features of my bigger laptop except a large screen  1 inch screen is bigger than the 8  i want a netbook for portability not screen real estate   i was willing to downsize my screen size in favor of portability and speed \n",
