  "The food for our event was delicious. The food in the lounge was great and very fresh,,, salads, sandwiches etc. As far as food, walk a few blocks toward Michigan Ave turn left or right and there are plently of less expensive places to eat.",
  "parking was expensive but I think this is common for San Fran. there is a fee for parking but well worth it seeing no where to park if you do have a car.",
  "3 quot widescreen display was a bonus. this made for smoother graphics on the 255w of the vehicle moving along displayed roads, where the 750's display was more of a jerky movement.",
  "overall performance is good but comfort level is poor. overall performance is good but comfort level is poor.",
  "the voice prompts and maps are wonderful especially when driving after dark. I also thought the the voice prompts of the 750 where more pleasant sounding than the 255w's.",
  "Front seats are very uncomfortable. No memory seats, no trip computer, can only display outside temp with trip odometer. needs power seats on the passenger side.",
  "this function is not accurate if you don't leave it in battery mode say, when you stop at the Cracker Barrell for lunch and to play one of those trangle games with the tees. it provides immediate alternatives if the route from the online map program was inaccurate or blocked by an obstacle.",
  "the location is perfect for perusing the shops at Fisherman's Wharf and proximity to San Francisco's streetcars. the hotel is in an excellent location, which you need for a short stay.",
  "Ride seems comfortable and gas mileage fairly good averaging 26 city and 30 open road. Seats are fine, in fact of all the smaller sedans this is the most comfortable I found for the price as I am 6', 2 and 250#.",
  "I bought the 8, gig Ipod Nano that has the built, in video camera. Itunes has an on, line store, where you may purchase and download music and videos which will install onto the ipod.",
  "a normal chain hotel on a nice location, I will be back if I do not find anthing closer to Picadilly for a better price.",
  "I love the new body style and the interior is a simple pleasure except for the center dash. but there are a couple of things that kill it for me 1 terrible driver seat comfort, kills my back 2 lack luster interior design.",
  "since the battery life difference is minimum, the only reason to upgrade would be to get the better keyboard. The keyboard is now as good as the HP and Samsung netbooks.",
  "another thing to consider was that I paid $50 less for the 750 and it came with the FM transmitter cable and a USB cord to connect it to your computer for updates and downloads. update and reroute much _more_ quickly than my other GPS.",
  "staff are friendly and helpful. the staff in the morning seemed to need another cup of coffee as they weren't excited to see us.",
  "Asus will not sell you a spare 3 or 6, cell Li, Ion battery. it also features a N270 cpu, 6, cell 48Wh Li, ion Battery 8. realistic battery numbers are between 8. of battery life if you're using wifi & doing email word processing YouTube web surfing.",
  "the location is a block away from the tube station and walking distance of a lot of attractions. the location is excellent, just a few minutes' walk from the hotel.",
  "it's fast to acquire satellites. it's fast to acquire satellites.",
  "I previously owned a Toyota 4Runner which had incredible build quality and reliability. I bought the Camry because of Toyota reliability and quality.",
  "the room was not overly big, but clean and very comfortable beds, a great shower and very clean bathrooms. the second room was smaller, but at least it was quieter and we were able to sleep.",
  "I had to uninstall anti, virus and selected other programs, some of which did not have listings in the Programs and Features Control Panel section. This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS.",
  "Mediocre room and service for a very extravagant price. The accomodations and support services are phenomenal. no robes in the rooms, ice machines are not on every floor, no turn down service at night.",
  "another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed.",
  "After slowing down, transmission has to be kicked to speed up. I wonder if the people who have problems with rattles and transmission were built in the US. The transmission, I don't know what to tell you, but good luck if you don't learn from my mistake.",
  "Windows 7 is quite simply faster, more stable, boots faster, goes to sleep faster, comes back from sleep faster, manages your files better and on top of that it's beautiful to look at and easy to use.",
  "The Eee Super Hybrid Engine utility lets users overclock or underclock their Eee PC's to boost performance or provide better battery life depending on their immediate requirements. in Super Performance mode CPU, Z shows the bus speed to increase up to 169.",
  "sound quality on the built in speaker is great and you do not need headphones at all to listen to music. sound quality on the speaker microphone is great and the picture quality will really surprise you.",
  "the 255w has an arrow at the top of the screen that shows the direction of the next turn. the screen is very bright and easy to see with direct sunlight and at night time.",
  "if you buy the extended warranty for $65 you pay $80 plus shipping to send the device to amazon and have the Kindle REPLACED. the battery door opening is thus solved, but amazon went further, eliminating the door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel.",
  "for whatever reason, Amazon decided to make the Font on the Home Screen than on the K1. I found myself constantly changing the angle of the body, changing the font size up and down and the distance away from me.",
  "it feels as easy to read as the K1 but doesn't seem any crisper to my eyes. the white is really GREY, and to avoid considerable eye, strain I had to refresh pages every other page.",
  "keep in mind that once you get in a room full of light or step outdoors screen reflections could become annoying. I've used mine outside on a sunny day, and the screen is still very much legible.",
  "it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do. it took very little time to get used to having to press a button to turn pages. the button hinges are on the outside, at the edge of the K2.",
  "You also get upscale features like spoken directions including street names and programmable POIs. I used to hesitate to go out of my directions but not any more. the directions didn't tell me anything I didn't already know after fiddling with it for 10 minutes. it also does not offer an option to view the route as a series of turn by turn directions.",
  "The Swissotel is one of our favorite hotels in Chicago and the corner rooms have the most fantastic views in the city. the rooms look like they were just remodled and upgraded, there was an HD TV and a nice iHome docking station to put my iPod so I could wake up with my music instead of the radio.",
  "the keyboards are 92% the size of those found on a standard computer and the machines run a little hot. the keyboard has a responsive feel and the larger keys along with the oversize right shift key are a real plus.",
  "the staff at Swissotel were not particularly nice. each time I waited at the counter for staff for several minutes and then was waved to the desk upon my turn with no hello or anything, or apology for waiting in line.",
  "interior has way too many cheap plastic parts like the cheap plastic center piece that houses the clock. 3 blown struts at 30,000 miles, interior trim coming loose and rattling squeaking, stains on paint, and bug splats taking paint off, premature uneven brake wear, on 3rd windshield.",
  "The room was packed to capacity with queues at the food buffets. The over zealous staff cleared our unfinished drinks while we were collecting cooked food and movement around the room with plates was difficult in the crowded circumstances.",
  "both of us having worked in tourism for over 14 years were very disappointed at the level of service provided by this gentleman. the service was good, very friendly staff and we loved the free wine reception each night.",
  "if a case was included, as with the Kindle 1, that would have been reflected in a higher price. lower overall price, with nice leather cover.",
  "Drivers seat not comfortable, the car itself compared to other models of similar class. It's very comfortable, remarkably large inside and just an overall great vehicle. Front seats are very uncomfortable. I'm 6' tall, and find the driving position pretty comfortable.",
  "Great Location, Nice Rooms, Helpless Concierge The rooms were bright, clean and the windows open. another odd thing we noticed is a majority of the room doors opened OUT into the hallway, rather than into the rooms.",
  "the wine reception is a great idea as it is nice to meet other travellers and great having access to the free Internet access in our room. the hotel also has a computer available with free internet which is a nice bonus but I didn't find that out till the day before we left but was still able to check our flight to Vegas the next day.",
  "as always, the video screen is sharp and bright. 2, inch screen and a glossy, polished aluminum finish that one CNET editor described as looking like a Christmas tree ornament. Still, video fans should consider stepping up to a product with a larger screen, such as the Zune HD or iPod Touch.",
  "Ride seems comfortable and gas mileage fairly good averaging 26 city and 30 open road. it gets great gas mileage. Being a mother who drives a lot I wanted a safe vehicle with good gas mileage and this car delivered that and more.",
  "In fact, the entire navigation structure has been completely revised, I'm still getting used to it but it's a huge improvement. Navigation is a huge improvement. Clearly, Amazon was hard at work to make navigation quicker and easier.",
  "it's quiet, get good gas mileage and looks clean inside and out. The mileage is great, and I've had to get used to stopping less for gas. Thought gas mileage would be better.",
  "the room was quiet, clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable, and the service was adequate. we arrived about 11 am, room was ready.",
  "the hotel was quiet, clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable, and the service was adequate. There were no service issues to speak of, but it's not an overly, friendly hotel.",
  "short battery life I moved up from an 8gb. I love this ipod except for the battery life. long battery scratch resistant Battery drains even if I don't use it. great in the car, light, portable, good quality, long battery,scratch resistant."
